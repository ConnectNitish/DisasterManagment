# DisasterManagment

	Project is about the managing the Impact of Natural Disaster. 
  
  In the aftermath of natural disasters, the first responders play a vital role in providing immediate relief to the 
  affected. So , in order to assist the first responders like policemen ,firemen , volunteers we need to provide  them with 
  precise , accurate and relevant information about extent of damage , the city is suffering which is updated at every instant.    
	Considering the scenario of Hurricane Harvey on Texas and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico where people were faced with difficulties;
	due to lack of information about status of road and rail connectivity ; accessing clean drinking water and location of shelter 
  homes and safe houses. With the help of above information ,they will be able to make an efficient plan and execute it in order to save
  as many lives as possible.
	
	We plan to make an website/app which will display the current state of the city (updated at every interval) using 
	Google street view api and Google maps api and highlighting the relevant areas like recommended routes , location of shelter homes , 
  safe houses etc. We will update the website content by scrapping for images from relevant sources like real time reputed news websites and applying 
  convoluted neural network on the images to find out affected areas and updating the same on our websites. 
	
	Powered by this information first responders and the netizens can chart their future course of action effectively. This data will also  be used by 
	first responders to find most affected areas and provide the efficient route to reach any respective areas. The city planners or the 
	government can use the current information to understand the damages suffered by the city and plan efficiently in order 
	to rebuild the city.
